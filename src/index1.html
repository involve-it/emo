  Dreamed of a river boat and a waterfall, and the snow on the trees and green grass at the same time.  I dreamed that I had superpowers, to turn back time or go back in time.  And I used them to save those people that were in the accident.  Such a strange dream.  I dreamed of you too, you told me, now we need to go back and show the clock

    In the dream, I was back in the past, and you slept on the beach, so hard, and got up a storm and you move a huge wave. And I began to wake you up, you're not drowned. And you're still asleep, and I pulled you up on the hill, to the forest. It was hard, but when I dragged the wave already covered the entire beach. And where were we, all was quiet. This stretch of sleep was very dark and scary.
