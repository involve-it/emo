    In the dream, I was back in the past, and you slept on the beach, so hard, and got up a storm and you move a huge wave. And I began to wake you up, you're not drowned. And you're still asleep, and I pulled you up on the hill, to the forest. It was hard, but when I dragged the wave already covered the entire beach. And where were we, all was quiet. This stretch of sleep was very dark and scary.
